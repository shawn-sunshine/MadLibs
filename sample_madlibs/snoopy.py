    madlib = f'If you are ever met my {animal}, Snoopy, then you know he is not your average canine companion. Some kids might find it {adj1} that their beagle has such a(n) {adj2} imagination, but not me! All I have ever wanted was a normal, {adj3} dog. Why cannot I have a(n) {noun1} just like everyone else? Instead, I have got a part time pet, part time World War I pilot, part time {noun2} and a full time pain! {adj4} grief! Sometimes he looks at me like I am chopped {type_of_food} - good for nothing except bringing his dinner out to (the) {place1}. Still, it sure is nice to have someone with really {adj5} ears around. And after a long day at (the) {place2}, there is nothing better than coming homne to a wet {noun3} on the cheek. Aw, who am I kidding? I am really lucky to have a(n) {noun4} like Snoopy. They do not call dogs man best {noun5} for nothing!'
