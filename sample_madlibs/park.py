    madlib = f'Today, my fabulous camp group went to a(n) {adj1} amusement park. It was a fun park with lots of cool {noun1} and enjoyable play structures. When we got there, my kind counselor shouted loudly, "Everybody off the {noun2}." We all pushed out in a terrible hurry. My counselor handed out yellow tickets, and we scurried in. I was so excited! I could not figure out what exciting thing to do first. I saw a scary roller coaster I really liked so I {adverb1} ran over to get in the long line that had about {number1} people in it. When I finally got on the roller coaster I was {verb1}. In fact, I was so nervous my two knees were knocking together. This was the {adj2} ride I had ever been on! In about two minutes I heard the crank and grinding of the gears. That is when the ride began! When I got to the bottom, I was a little {verb2} but I was proud of myself. The rest of the day went {adverb2}. It was a(n) {adj3} day at the fun park.'
